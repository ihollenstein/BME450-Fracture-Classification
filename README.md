## Project Description
The goal of the project is to train a nueral network to classify whether an X-ray image displays a fractured bone.  If a fracture is identified, the type of fracture is identified into one of the following catagories: avulsion fracture, comminuted fracture, fracture disslocation, greenstick fracture, hairline fracture, impacted fracture, longitudinal fracture, oblique fracture, pathological fracture, and spiral fractures.  Training a neural network to identify the existence of a fracture, as well as the type of fracture will help streamline diagnoses from X-ray images in the healthcare industry, which will reduce waiting times of patients.  For this project, two data sets were used from Kaggle to gather X-ray images.  The first, "Bone Fracture Multi-Region X-ray Data," provides images of healthy bones without breaks.  The second dataset, "Bone Break Classification Image Dataset,"  provides images of fractures, as well as type of fracture from one of the categories listed above.  Theses X-ray images will be used to train and test the neural network on the presence or absence of a fracture and the classification of a fracture should one exist.
